## This is my repository for the project described in the book Pro MERN Stack (2nd Ed) by Vasan Subramanian. This readme contains progresses I made through each chapter. :beers:

###### Chapter 14
In this chapter, I used Google to authenticate a user. Particularly, I used JWT to persist session information in a stateless, yet secure manner. Then I utilized GraphQL APIs for authentication and extended it to perform different authorization checks. In addition, I also used CORS and cookie handling restrictions on the browser when the browser accesses APIs directly.

###### Chapter 13
In this chapter, I first impletmented a common React pattern for reusable code: Higer Order Components(HOCs). Then I utilized MongoDB's aggregate framework to summarize or even expand the data fetched from collections. I also implemented common features, and used third-party components for undoing a delete and adding pagination, and used a search control for finding issues based on a text index in MongoDB.

###### Chapter 12
In this chapter, I realized server rendering, enabling generation of HTML on the server in addition to being able to render directly to the DOM. This enables creation of isomorphic applications which use the same codebase on the server asl well as the client to do either task.: render to the DOM or create HTML.

###### Chapter 11
In this chapter, I added styles and themes to the issue tracker. I added buttons, a navigation bar, panels, tables, forms, grid systems, inline forms, horizontal forms, validation alerts, and modals.

###### Chapter 10
In this chapter, I added an Edit page using forms that explored controlled and uncontrolled form components. In addition, I also added new APIs to cater to the needs of the new form and completed the CRUD paradigm by adding a Delete operation. Most importantly, I created specialized input components that could deal with different data types.

###### Chapter 9
In this chapter, I implemented client-side routing to show different pages depending on links in a menu or a navigation bar with the help of the React Router library. In addition, I also managed to connect the URL in the browser with what is shown in the page, and how parameters and query strings can be used to tweak the page contents.

###### Chapter 8
In this chapter, I modularized the code with the help of Webpack. I removed dependencies on the CDN for runtime libraries and created bundles for those. In addition, Webpack's HMR helped me increase productivity by efficiently replacing modules in the browser.

###### Chapter 7
In this chapter, an architectural change by spliting the UI and the API servers is conducted. In addition, a proxy server is set up to support CORS. In the end, linting eslint is added to sanitize codes.

###### Chapter 6
By implementing a simple CRUD application, I utilized the mongo shell and the Node.js driver to modify the Issue Tracker Application and use some of the methods to read and write to MongoDB.

###### Chapter 5
By utilizing GraphQL, I built the C and R part of the CRUD, moving the array of issues from the browser's memory to the server's memory. In addition to that, I implemented input validations and error display.

###### Chapter 4
By making changes to state, I added new issues based on user interactions. The state values were propagated down the compenent hierarchy as props. I utilized simulated synchronous calls and data local to the browser to achieve this.

###### Chapter 3
I built up a main page of the Issue Tracker. This chapter introduced the use of React classes, including composing individual components and composing components using other components. Beyond that, reusing a component by passing parameters from itself to its children rendered it differently with different data.

###### Chapter 2
I completed the basic setup of a MERN project, moving from a server-less 'Hello World' to a server-backed one. I downloaded nvm, Node.js, Express and learned to seperate scripts from the html file so that efficiency improved. Besides that, I also customized commands and tried to use babel to transpile and provide compatibility across different versions of browsers.
